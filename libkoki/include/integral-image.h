 *
 * Integral images are useful for summing areas of pixels within an image.
 * This structure contains information about an integral image, including
 * the image itself.  In particular, this structure supports an integral
 * image being constructed gradually.
 *
 * Pixels in the integral image should be accessed using the 
 * \c koki_integral_image_pixel macro.
