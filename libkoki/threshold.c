 * @brief performs a linear search for the threshold that is equdistant to

 * Starting at some initial threshold, the greyscale value of the pixels that
 * are thresholded white are averaged, and the same for the thresholded black
 * pixels.  The aim of this algorithm is to find the threshold that sits in
 * the middle of the two averages (computed using that threshold).
 *
 * The test threshold sweeps from some minimum threshold, up to some maximum
 * threshold.  For each threshold, both the average white value and the average
 * black value are calculated.  The algorithm stops when threshold is
 * approximately equidistant to both averages, i.e. the threshold is
 * approximately equal to the average of the average white and average black
 * values.  The search stops when:
